                Voices of Hope" is a community-based organization
                developed by individuals who have experienced trauma
                within the United States Family Law System. Our Facebook
                group is dedicated to empowering the voices and messages
                of hope from the healers, heroes, and victims who have
                overcome or are still oppressed and struggling through
                trauma within the Family Law System in the United States.

                The main focus of our community is to empower awareness
                and resources to create global change and stop all abuse,
                trauma, and neglect that is occurring right now within
                millions of cases across America. All forms of domestic
                violence, such as abuse, oppression, or manipulation of
                their children, must be identified and stopped immediately.
